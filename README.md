## Quick Lookup

HTML | Description
--- | ---
```<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 3.2 //EN">``` | This is the necessary first element of any HTML 3.2 compliant document
```<html>...< /html>``` | Encloses the entire document.
```<head>...< /head>``` | Encloses the head of the document. The following optional tags are placed inside the head.
```<title>...< /title>``` | Indicates the title of the document that is used as the window caption. This is the second of the two required tags for any HTML 3.2 compliant document.
```<body>..< /body>``` | Encloses the main body of the document.
```<img src="" alt="">``` | Places an inline image into the document.
```<a href="">...< /a>``` | The enclosed text and/or graphic becomes a link to another document or anchor.
```<ul><li>...</li><li>...</li></ul>``` | Used to mark text as a list item.
```<form>...</form>``` | Specifies a form. Forms can be used to send user input to the server in the form of NAME/VALUE pairs.
```<input type="" name="" />``` | Specifies a control or input area for a form, from which a NAME/VALUE pair will be returned to the server.
```<textarea cols="" row="" name="">...< /textarea>``` | Creates a multi-lined text entry box. Any text placed in between the tags is used as the default text string that is displayed when the page is loaded.
```<link rel=stylesheet href="URL of style sheet" type="text/css" >``` | Inside the HEAD tag, add something like this to link stylesheet html file
```<br/>``` | inserts a line break
```<p>...</ p>``` | Designates the enclosed text as a plain paragraph. 
```<div>...</ div>``` | Sets divisions on the page to allow for styling or positioning.

CSS | Description
--- | ---
margin: 10px 20px 5px 0 | The 'margin' property is a shorthand property for setting 'margin-top', 'margin-right', 'margin-bottom', and 'margin-left' at the same place in the style sheet.
padding: 10px 20px 5px 0 | These properties set the top, right, bottom, and left padding of a box.
font-family: 'Roboto', sans-serif; | This property specifies a prioritized list of font family names and/or generic family names.
background-color: red / #fff / #123456 | This property sets the background color of an element, either a <color> value or a keyword like 'transparent', to make the underlying colors shine through.
text-decoration | This property describes decorations that are added to the text of an element. If the property is specified for a block-level element, it affects all inline-level descendants of the element. If it is specified for (or affects) an inline-level element, it affects all boxes generated by the element. If the element has no content or no text content (e.g., the IMG element in HTML), user agents must ignore this property.
line-height | If the property is set on a block-level element whose content is composed of inline-level elements, it specifies the minimal height of each generated inline box.
color | This property describes the foreground color of an element's text content.
float | This property specifies whether a box should float to the left, right, or not at all. It may be set for elements that generate boxes that are not absolutely positioned.
max-width | These two properties allow authors to constrain box widths to a certain range.
text-align | This property describes how inline content of a block is aligned.
list-style | The 'list-style' property is a shorthand notation for setting the three properties 'list-style-type', 'list-style-image', and 'list-style-position' at the same place in the style sheet.
font-size | This property describes the size of the font when set solid.
clear | This property indicates which sides of an element's box(es) may not be adjacent to an earlier floating box.
